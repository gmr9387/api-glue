# Valtaris Glue — Implementation Status

Honest matrix of what is shipped vs. work-in-progress vs. planned. Updated
alongside the runtime; not aspirational.

## REAL — production behavior in place

- Durable job queue (`workflow_jobs`, `claim_next_job`, partitions, leases, DLQ)
- Worker runtime (`run-worker`, registry, heartbeats, draining, lease renewal)
- DAG executor (parallel fan-out, branch, approval, rollback nodes)
- Retry / backoff (classified errors, jittered exponential)
- Checkpoints + observational replay (`workflow_checkpoints`, pinned-version replays)
- Telemetry stream (`workflow_events` + realtime channels)
- Telemetry rollups (`aggregate_telemetry`, cron-scheduled)
- SLA breach detection (`detect_sla_breaches`, `workflow_incidents`)
- Approvals (tenant-scoped, signed, replay-safe via `decision_id`)
- Rollback / compensation (reverse-walk over checkpoints)
- Circuit breakers (per-connector, half-open probing)
- Tenant isolation (`tenant_id` + RLS + `has_role` on operational paths)
- Workflow versioning (draft → published → archived, publish-gate validation)
- External triggering (webhook, scheduler, event-router edge functions)
- Workflow templates + connector catalog + deployment validation
- Distributed tracing (`trace_spans` + OTLP-compatible export)
- Operator console (Command Center, Workflow Studio, Runtime Inspector, Platform, Docs)

## PARTIAL — primitives exist, end-to-end gaps remain

- **Connector adapter coverage.** Stripe / OpenAI / SendGrid execute against
  real APIs when secrets are present. Slack, Twilio, Salesforce return
  realistic mock responses by default; happy-path only tested in mock mode.
- **Multi-region routing.** `region` columns are populated; the scheduler
  does not yet enforce region-affine job claims.
- **Worker host model.** Workers run as Supabase edge functions, bounded by
  edge runtime limits. A long-lived host (Fly Machine / Cloud Run) is
  designed but not deployed.
- **Load test harness.** `load-harness` generates synthetic workflows and
  persists results to `load_benchmarks`; no published throughput baselines.
- **Telemetry granularity.** Aggregates roll up at one-minute resolution;
  sub-minute spikes visible only in raw `workflow_events`.

## PLANNED — designed, not yet started

- Replay re-execution mode (currently observational only) with
  idempotency-key enforcement across all connectors.
- Per-tenant rate limiting at `claim_next_job`.
- Enforced multi-region job routing with cross-region replication SLAs.
- Long-lived worker process deployment with edge functions reserved for
  the control plane.
- Published throughput baselines and an SLO catalog.
- Expanded first-class connector coverage (HubSpot, Notion, GitHub, custom HTTP).
- Visual rollback path inspector (currently surfaced only via raw events).

## Non-goals (for now)

- Acting as a managed message broker.
- Competing on raw throughput with Temporal / Inngest at multi-region scale.
- Built-in code execution / arbitrary scripting inside workflow nodes.
