# Valtaris Glue

**Telemetry-native workflow orchestration runtime.**

Valtaris Glue is a durable, replayable, governance-aware workflow execution
engine. It persists every step of a multi-connector workflow, drives execution
through a queue of leased jobs processed by horizontally scalable workers,
and emits a telemetry stream that can be replayed deterministically from
checkpoints.

This README describes the system honestly — what is real, what is partial,
and what is planned. It is not marketing copy.

---

## What Valtaris Glue Is

- A backend-driven orchestration runtime with a React operator console.
- A pinned-version DAG executor: every run is bound to an immutable
  `workflow_version_id` so in-flight runs survive new publishes.
- A telemetry surface: `workflow_events`, `telemetry_aggregates`, distributed
  `trace_spans`, and an OTLP-compatible export endpoint.
- A governance layer: approval gates, signed operator decisions, tenant-scoped
  RLS, and an append-only `security_events` audit trail.
- A platform: workflow templates, a connector catalog with capability metadata,
  deployment validation, and onboarding tracking.

It is **not** a managed message broker, not a Temporal/Inngest replacement at
scale, and not (yet) a multi-region cluster. It is a single-cluster execution
engine with the right primitives in place.

Supporting control plane:

```text
sla-sweeper       → detect_sla_breaches, sweep_stale_jobs
control-plane     → drain_worker, pause/resume partition, reconcile_orphans
rollback-executor → walks checkpoints in reverse, runs compensation
approval-decision → resume_after_approval / reject_approval
replay-workflow   → reconstructs a run from workflow_checkpoints
scale-monitor     → capture_queue_pressure, scaling recommendations
platform-control  → template install, export pack, deployment validation
```

## Execution Flow

1. `execute-workflow` receives a published DAG, creates a `workflow_runs` row
   pinned to a `workflow_version_id`, and expands the DAG into
   `workflow_jobs` honoring `dependsOn`.
2. `run-worker` calls `claim_next_job(worker_id)` — a `SECURITY DEFINER`
   function that selects the next eligible job with
   `FOR UPDATE OF j SKIP LOCKED`, honoring partition pause/concurrency caps.
3. The worker resolves the node's connector adapter, enforces a per-call
   timeout, classifies errors, and writes a `workflow_step_runs` row plus a
   `workflow_checkpoints` snapshot.
4. Connector outcomes feed `record_connector_result`, which drives a circuit
   breaker (`closed → open → half_open`) per connector.
5. On retryable failure, the centralized retry policy schedules exponential
   backoff with full jitter; on terminal failure the job moves to
   `workflow_dead_letter` and a `workflow_incidents` row is opened.
6. When all sink nodes complete, the run transitions to `completed`.
7. `sla-sweeper` runs on a per-minute cron to detect breaches and reclaim
   stale leases via `sweep_stale_jobs`.

## Core Features

- **Durable queue** with partitions, leases, dead-letter, and pressure signals.
- **Pinned-version execution** so publishes never disturb in-flight runs.
- **Observational replay** from `workflow_checkpoints` joined with
  `workflow_events`.
- **Approval gates** with signed operator decisions and audit trail.
- **Rollback / compensation** by reverse-walking checkpoints.
- **Circuit breakers** per connector with half-open probing.
- **Distributed tracing** via `trace_spans` and OTLP export.
- **Workflow Studio** with cycle / orphan / unreachable detection.
- **Runtime Inspector** — timeline, event log, checkpoint replay, diffing.
- **Platform** — workflow templates, connector catalog, deployment validation.
- **Webhook / scheduler / event ingress** for externally-triggered workflows.

## What Is Partial

| Subsystem              | Status  | Gap                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Connector adapters     | Partial | Stripe / OpenAI / SendGrid real; others mock-default |
| Multi-region routing   | Partial | `region` columns present; routing not enforced       |
| Worker host model      | Partial | Edge-function workers; long-lived host not yet wired |
| Load test harness      | Partial | `load-harness` exists; published baselines pending   |
| Aggregate granularity  | Partial | One-minute rollups; sub-minute only via raw events   |

See `docs/STATUS.md` for the full REAL / PARTIAL / PLANNED matrix.

## Roadmap

1. Long-lived worker process (Fly Machine / Cloud Run) with edge functions
   reserved for the control plane.
2. Replay re-execution mode with idempotency-key enforcement (currently
   observational only).
3. Per-tenant rate limiting at `claim_next_job`.
4. Enforced multi-region job routing.
5. Published throughput baselines from the load harness.
6. Expanded connector coverage beyond Stripe / OpenAI / SendGrid.

## Local Setup

Prerequisites: Bun, a Supabase project (or Lovable Cloud), the keys below.

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in real values
bun run dev
```

Required env vars (see `.env.example`):

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`

Backend secrets (Stripe, OpenAI, SendGrid, Slack, Twilio, Salesforce) are
configured on the backend; the frontend never sees them. Missing secrets
trigger mock-mode adapter responses so the runtime stays exercisable.

---

## Validation / Testing

```bash
bun run lint        # eslint
bun run test        # vitest
bun run build       # vite production build
```

Runtime validation endpoints:

- `runtime-validate` — consistency checks across runs, checkpoints, jobs.
- `worker-health` — worker liveness probe.
- `scale-monitor` — queue-pressure recommendations.
- `load-harness` — synthetic throughput harness.
